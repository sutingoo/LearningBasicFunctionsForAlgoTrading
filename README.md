# LearningBasicFunctionsForAlgoTrading
This repository was created to show my "mini_projects" that I created for learning Algorithmic Trading, this codes are so simple and I just show functions, analisys, and graphics. Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

..All code was made using Jupyter Notebook..

# Dia1
The "Day 1" project was "Understanding Basic Functions." This day was quite simple, as it only covered basic Python concepts such as variable definitions, working with strings, creating dictionaries, using if statements to compare numbers, and printing the results.

# Dia2
The "Day 2" project aimed to backtest Bitcoin data from 2022-01-01 to 2023-01-01 using the EMA Crossover strategy. The goal was to compare the performance of this strategy against a simple buy-and-hold approach. Additionally, the code calculated key metrics such as maximum drawdown and the Sharpe ratio. Finally, it generated a capital evolution chart to visualize how effective the strategy was over time.
